# Exercise

The exercise is to build out this news website homepage and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools/frameworks/libraries you like to help you complete it.

## Notes

I went with a mobile-first approach, and no external libraries/frameworks were used to create this project. I used vanilla Javascript, HTML5, and plain CSS. You can simply open the **index.html** file on your browser and use the dev tools to change the screen's width. I only optimized the CSS for **375px** and **1440px**, so please use these widths to view the site. I didn't bother with the widths inbetween, but that can be arranged with a few more CSS media queries. I also completed the bonus challenges, so you can toggle the menu bar and take a look, and in the case of the API not being able to fetch data for whatever reason, I used the default data based on the screenshots you provided. I provided my own **final-design** folder which has a screenshot of the mobile, and desktop versions of the site. If you set the width to 375px or 1440px and your UI doesn't reflect to the ones in the **final-design** folder, try refreshing your browser.
