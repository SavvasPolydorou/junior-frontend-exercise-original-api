# Exercise

The exercise is to build out this news website homepage and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools/frameworks/libraries you like to help you complete it.

## Tasks

Your tasks are:

1. Create the desktop version and the mobile version using responsive media queries. Please look at the screenshots at the "design" folder for the final result.
2. Add hover and focus states for the top header menu
3. **Bonus**: Toggle the mobile menu (requires some JavaScript)
4. **Bonus**: There are 3 items at the "New" section. Get the first 3 items from this API endpoint https://6380ce5a786e112fe1ba951e.mockapi.io/Articles and show the title and description fields to match the design. You can show the first X characters from the title and description if they are too long.

## How to deliver

You can share the results with us:

1. By sharing the github repository you uploaded the solution.
2. By sending us the files directly.

For any method you choose, is better to have detailed instructions on how to run the project.
